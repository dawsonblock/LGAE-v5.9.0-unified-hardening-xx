"""v5.1 Bridge between StructuralAction proposals and concrete mutations.

The structural executive proposes actions as `StructuralAction` enum values.
The governor certifies concrete mutation objects (AddEdge, PruneEdge, etc.).
This module bridges the two worlds:

    StructuralAction → concrete Mutation object → governor.evaluate_mutation

This keeps the executive as a pure proposal generator while ensuring
all proposals go through the authoritative governor for certification.
